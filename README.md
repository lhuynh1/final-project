# devCollab - A space where developers can … collab! 

## What does it do & why is it important? 
This application has the simple purpose of creating a space where developers can connect with other developers on projects where one person might have an expertise in a specific area or language. Upon creating an account, you can post open projects or project ideas in hopes of sparking an interest in other developers that want to contribute. If you don’t have a project and are looking to contribute on some cool projects on the side, there will be an option to pull up searches of project postings based on what languages you search for. All project postings will includes what technologies and languages used so that theses keywords can be searchable later. This is valuable in the sense that its a space that cultivates collaboration on projects that can have an impact on the world. It helps to bring developers together on projects that you might not have stumbled upon anywhere else. We hope to build a community of innovation and just a fun place to find cool projects.
